                    BRIEF CLOUD COMPUTING

exercise 

You work as a securi ty archi tect in a bank. Management sees the
IT expenses related to hardware (infrastructure) increased.
They are convinced that moving to the cloud will reduce costs.
The company has 3 physical servers (database, web application
server, application server and a siem), wi th backup and
replication functionali ties for company and employee data as well
as APC hardware (for Power cuts).
You decide to conduct research to measure the potential impacts

A/
                     ***PUBLIC CLOUD***

A public cloud is an IT infrastructure in which a service provider makes resources available to the public via the internet. The resources vary depending on the provider but may include storage capacity, applications or virtual machines.

A private cloud provides cloud computing services to authorised users via the Internet or an internal network. Since it can only be used by a clearly defined group of users, the Private Cloud is also called the Corporate Cloud or Internal Cloud.

A hybrid cloud mixes two or more types of cloud environments. Hybrid cloud deployments combine public and private clouds, and may also include existing on-premises infrastructure. For a cloud to be truly hybrid, these different cloud environments must be tightly interconnected with each other and essentially function as one combined infrastructure.

B/
                  ***CLOUD PROVIDERS***
***
In the lead is Amazon Web Services with around 33% of the market share.

        Services: IaaS Paas Saas
        Cloud storage 
        Hybrid cloud and multi cloud
        Test and developement 
        Data recovery

Followed by Microsoft with its Azure solution which represents 21% which shows a significant difference between the two leading providers.

In third place you will find Google with Google Cloud which represent approximately 8%.

and for finnish our ranking we will find the chinese giant with 7%.

             better availability

**Azure cloud ressources compare with Amazon web Services (per day)**

**Database** SQL(32gb): Azure Cloud: 28 euros /day 
                    Aws:         13.25 euros /day

                    ***Risks that migration to the cloud***

        If your application contains and retrieves highly sensitive data, you may not be able to maintain it in the cloud. Similarly, compliance requirements may also limit your choices.

        If any of the technology you currently rely on is proprietary software, you may not be legally able to deploy it in the cloud.

        Additional latency when using cloud applications over the Internet.

        Your particular application design and architecture may not completely follow distributed cloud architectures and may therefore require some modifications.

        Its computer networks are potentially attackable and virtual services can be taken down.

        The cloud allows better availability.
